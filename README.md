This project help to identify the most significant recurrent patterns and cause of road traffic crashes in Nigeria. The data used was collected from Federal Road Safety Corps website which keeps records of road accidents for every state in the country. The data was transformed and cleaned using Microsoft Excel and Power BI. I used Power BI to create a dashboard to give further insight about the crashes.
